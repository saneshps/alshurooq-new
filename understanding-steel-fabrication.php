              <h1> Understanding Steel Fabrication </h1>

              <p> There’s no confusion as to why steel is being used in the manufacturing industries, construction,
                aircraft and other sectors. Therefore it’s important to understand steel fabrication and the
                various processes involved in its manufacturing. The process of steel fabrication becomes
                important as the metal steel takes various shapes like channels, angles, bars, beams, sheets,
                coils and much more. Hence it's exciting to learn and understand the vast and amazing
                spectrum of steel fabrication.
              </p>
              <p> Let's comprehend the definition, types, and industrial applications of steel manufacturing. </p>
              <h3> What is Steel Fabrication? </h3>
              <p> Steel Fabrication is the process of transforming raw steel into various types of products
                or items through the application of several techniques.Steel fabrication is widely used
                in jobs related to construction and assembly. To obtain the final product, steel is often cut,
                bent, connected and molded.
              </p>
              <p> Special skills, training and hands-on experience are required for the team involved
                in this fabrication process. There is little option to make errors or metal wastage
                during the fabrication. The most common methods of <a href="https://alshurooq.ae/steel-structures.php" target="_blank"> steel fabrication </a> are:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li> <strong> Machining: </strong> Steel parts are shaved off using drills, mills and lathes to get the desired shape and texture. </li>
                <li> <strong> Cutting: </strong> Steel metal is cut either using shears or bandsaws using high pressure water gives accurate cuts. </li>
                <li> <strong> Welding: </strong> is the process of joining different steel pieces or branding steel metal pieces that already exist. </li>

              </ul>

              <h3> Steel Fabrication Process </h3>
              <p> Since steel fabrication is a complicated process, it’s always advisable that
                trained steel fabricators do it. Various products that can be made out of
                steel by steel fabrication are universal columns and beams, ladders, skids,
                pipe racks etc.

              </p>
              <h4> 1. Plan and Design </h4>
              <p> Planning and designing is very essential before we start with the process of steel fabrication.
                It helps to reduce any kind of errors by the time the process gets over as well as raw material wastages.
                Thanks to technology, the advent of softwares like AutoCAD is widely recommended to use for drafting to
                make the steel fabrication process seamless. Accurate and swift. You can seek the help of skilled
                draftsmen who can try out various design options to choose from based on the customer requirements
                before you work with steel and iron.

              </p>
              <p> Planning also includes listing the raw materials required for steel fabrication.
                Based on this list the Purchase and Procurement team are supposed to buy the required steel.
                Finalizing the CAD drawings based on the specifications, features, planning a schedule and
                job timelines, listing down the safety precautions to be taken, combining the steel purchased,
                doing quantity and quality checks are also part of planning.

              </p>

              <h4>2. Marking </h4>
              <p> Once planning and design is completed, marking is the next process that comes in the
                steel fabrication. With the help of several tools, very small measurements can be
                marked on steel to enable accurate cutting of material and steel fabrication.
              </p>
              <p> It’s highly important to do protective coatings on the steel workpiece to protect
                it from corrosion before starting the process to make sure the end product is corrosion free.
              </p>
              <h4>3. Cutting and Drilling </h4>
              <p> Once marking is done, the next process is cutting. <a href="https://alshurooq.ae/cnc-plasma-cutting.php" target="_blank"> Cutting</a> helps in removing any scrap
                or chip present in excess in the workpiece.These excess is sent to recycling centers
                for steel scrap recycling. The process of cutting includes shear cutting, wedge action and abrasion.
                In some cases like sheets of steel, there won’t be any scrap of chip present and sheets can be cut perfectly.
                These remaining steel sheets can be further used for steel fabrication.

              </p>
              <h4> 4. Bending </h4>
              <p> <a href="https://alshurooq.ae/cnc-bending.php" target="_blank"> Bending </a>the steel is achieved by applying pressure between two ends where bend or curve has to be done.
                This is usually done using a press or roller bender andbars, plates and sheets can be curved or bent with it.
                The most widely used bending processes are air bending, roll bending and coining. Each of these processes
                differ in the amount of pressure applied to achieve the result.
              </p>
              <p> Once you are done with cutting and bending of steel, the next step is to assemble
                the various pieces to form the end product. This is achieved by either welding,
                or screwing or bolting depending on the requirements.
              </p>

              <h4> 5. Welding and Screwing </h4>
              <p> Welding, bolting, screwing are the different types of joining processes used in steel fabrication. </p>
              <p> As we know welding is the process of joining or fusing the metal together.
                In this process heat is applied initially to melt and then join the metals after
                which the pieces are cooled for fusing it together.
              </p>
              <p> The process of bolting is often used as a replacement to welding when working with structural steel.
                Bolting involves drilling holes in the steel metal. Incases of materials with lesser thickness,
                punching is used. Once the holes are made, the joining is done by inserting fasteners.
                Since bolts can be removed as and when required, it’s considered as a temporary process.
                Another major factor to be considered is that the bolts can contract or expand over a period of time.
                Hence it’s very important to make sure they are fastened properly.
              </p>
              <h4> 6. Finishing and Quality Checks </h4>
              <p> Upon finishing the steel fabrication process as such, the next thing to be done is quality check.
                This step focuses on applying corrosion resistant coatings. This will add to steel protection as
                well as aesthetics.Cleaning the surface also adds to durability and appearance. Surface treatments
                like painting, anodising and galvanizing are done to finish the product.
              </p>
              <p> Quality checks are done to make sure the steel fabrication is done in accordance with the planning done initially.
                Various modes of quality checks include visual inspections, mechanical checks and NBT testing.
              </p>
              <h4> 7. Transportation and Installation </h4>
              <p> The process of steel fabrication ends with transportation and installation of the final steel product.
                Conveyors or cranes can be made use of to move the final steel product. Chains or lifting brackets
                can be utilized for temporary lifting. Whatever options are chosen, safety guidelines
                should not be compromised.

              </p>
