							<h4> The CNC Press Brake Symphony: </h4>

							<p> CNC Bending or folding unfolds its magic through the symphony of a CNC press brake. Picture this: the top beam, known as the ram, fitted with a punch, and the bottom beam clamped with a die, typically in the form of a V shape. The orchestration of this process is precise and dynamic, with the punch and die tailored to the material type, sheet thickness, and the geometric intricacies of the part at hand.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li> <span> 2. </span>
							<h4> Precision Defined by Punch and Die: </h4>

							<p> The heart of CNC Bending/Folding lies in the size and shape of the punch and die. A meticulous calibration, it's these elements that ensure the accurate shaping of materials. The punch force and die dimensions are determined by factors such as material type, sheet thickness, and the specific geometry of the part being crafted.
							</p>
						</li>
						<li> <span> 3. </span>
							<h4> Technological Prowess Unleashed: </h4>

							<p> Our arsenal boasts both a Servo Electric press brake with 5 Axis CNC Controlled back gauges and a Tandem type Hydraulic press brake with 6 Axis CNC controlled back gauges. These technological marvels elevate our capabilities to produce parts with tight tolerances and precise shapes. With the capacity to handle parts up to 8 meters in length and a punch force of up to 800 tons, our CNC Bending/Folding services redefine what's achievable in sheet metal processing.

		<input type="radio" name="radacc" class="accordian-chk" checked />
		<h3 class="accordian-header active">
		1.	What is 5-axis CNC machining? 
			<span class="acc-icon"></span>
		</h3>
		<div class="accordian-content" tabindex="2">
			<p> CNC Bending uses a computer-controlled press brake to bend sheet metal into precise shapes.
				 The machine guides the punch and die to form the desired angles, ensuring accuracy and repeatability.
				  It's widely used for making components like brackets and frames, enclosures etc.

		 2.	What types of materials can be used for CNC bending?  
			<span class="acc-icon"></span>
		</h3>
		<div class="accordian-content">
			<p>  CNC bending is used mainly for bending metals, such as steel, aluminum, stainless steel, and copper.   </p>

		3.	What are the common applications of CNC bending?  
			<span class="acc-icon"></span>
		</h3>
		<div class="accordian-content">
			<p>  CNC bending is employed in various industries, like metal fabrication, automotive, construction, and aerospace.   </p>
		</div>

	<div class="accordion">
		<input type="radio" name="radacc" class="accordian-chk" />
		<h3 class="accordian-header">
		4. 	What is the maximum thickness of material that can be cut with CNC bending?  
			<span class="acc-icon"></span>
		</h3>
		<div class="accordian-content">
			<p>  The maximum thickness depends on the machine's capacity and tooling. Typically,
				 CNC press brakes can bend materials up to 20 mm (0.75 inches) thick, though this
				  varies based on the material's type, strength, and the machine's tonnage capacity.

		<h3 class="accordian-header">
		5. 	What is the k-Factor in Bending?  
			<span class="acc-icon"></span>
		</h3>
		<div class="accordian-content">
			<p>  The K-Factor in bending is the ratio that helps determine how much the metal stretches
				 during the bending process. It represents the position of the neutral axis, which is 
				 the point in the metal that doesn't compress or stretch during the bend. The K-Factor
				  typically ranges from 0 to 0.5, depending on the material type and thickness.
				   A higher K-Factor means the neutral axis is closer to the outer edge, resulting in more stretching.

		<h3 class="accordian-header">
		6. 	What all are the advantages of CNC Bending?â€™  
			<span class="acc-icon"></span>
		</h3>
		<div class="accordian-content">
			<p>  Advantages of CNC bending are High Precision, Repeatability, Efficiency, Flexibility,
				 Reduced Wastage and Safety. These advantages make CNC bending ideal for industries needing accuracy and efficiency.
