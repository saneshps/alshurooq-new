              <h1>  Myths About Water Jet Cutting – Debunked
              </h1>


              <p> No matter what the era, myths are something that will float around almost anything. CNC Waterjet cutting machines are not an exemption.
                  There are quite a few myths surrounding these machines these days.

                  </p>
                  <p>It is important that these misconceptions must be addressed and made clear for something as advantageous as the water jet cutting machine.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  This blog intends to debunk some such myths and shed some light into the plain facts about CNC waterjet cutting machines.
                    </p>
            
              <h4> The Cost myth </h4>
              <p class="p-l-align">This is a common misconception regarding the waterjet cutting machine, especially among the new customers.</p>
              <p class="p-l-align"> While a waterjet cutting machine’s initial cost may seem steep, its efficiency, precision and rapid operation usually pays off in the long run. 
                Let’s be honest here: Nothing is free. Everything comes with a price, and this too. Dissecting the whole process of a  
                <a href="https://alshurooq.ae/cnc-water-jet-cutting.php" target="_blank">
                 CNC waterjet cutting </a> machine reveals that the main costs involved are the abrasive material, electricity,
                 water, and other replaceable parts.

              </p>

                  <p class="p-l-align">Garnet or the abrasive is the most expensive part of a waterjet cutting process.
                     Recycling the used abrasives is another solid option that will further minimize expenses.
                     </p>
                 
                      <p class="p-l-align">
                        Apart from this, it offers a lot of other advantages.
                      </p>
                     

<ul>
  <li>  No heat-affected zones; it does not weaken the workpiece material.

  </li>

  <li>
   It provides precise cutting, thereby doing away with the need for any secondary finishing.
  </li>

  <li>
    Owing to its narrow kerf, it delivers accurate cutting, resulting in less scrap material and minimal wastage.
  </li>

  <li>
    	It is eco-friendly as it does not emit toxic fumes or other pollutants.
  </li>
  
</ul>

   <p class="p-l-align">
    So, while the initial costs stand quite upfront, it is highly profitable considering its long-term benefits.
</p>

   <h4> Do you need noise cancellation?  </h4>
              <p class="p-l-align">  The older versions of waterjet cutting machines used to be quite noisy. 
                But the latest models are much quieter, if not completely silent.

              </p>

                     <p class="p-l-align">  The new waterjet cutting system features functions that allow the operator to adjust the water level in the tank. 
                      When the workpiece is cut under a thin layer of water, the noise level is reduced from 95 decibels to 75 decibels, 
                      which renders the whole process that can be completed with a safe noise level.

              </p>

              
   <h4>	Can a waterjet pump blow up?  </h4>
              <p class="p-l-align"> Manufacturers of water jet cutting machines strictly adhere to specific industry standards 
                and specifications while designing a high-pressure pump.
                 They design the waterjet pumps to leak, to avoid pressure build-up and effectively avoid sudden explosion.

              </p>
              <p class="p-l-align">
                It is a known fact that water is less compressible than air and a waterjet pump will have much less energy stored as well.
              </p>

               <h4>	Does Garnet Mesh Size Matter? </h4>
              <p class="p-l-align"> Garnet mesh size does have an impact on the cutting speed. The larger the mesh abrasives are, the faster they tend to cut, leaving a slightly rough surface finish. Abrasives with a mesh size of 60 cut much faster and are suited for thick materials.

              </p>
              <p class="p-l-align">
                A mesh size of 80 is commonly used for normal waterjet cutting applications and 
                finer ones with about 100 mesh deliver a smoother edge, but the cutting speed will tend to be slower.
              </p>

              <h4>Is Waterjet cutting that slow? </h4>
              <p class="p-l-align">It is a common misconception that waterjet cutting is slow, since it takes place underwater. But it’s not true.
              

              </p>
              <p class="p-l-align">
                Waterjet cutting machines are designed to cut through materials at high speed. Altering the pressure and speed of the waterjet can further increase the cutting speed. It also depends on the material and its thickness that is to be cut.
                 Soft materials like plastic can be cut quickly, while the cutting time for hard materials like steel tends to be slower.
              </p>

              <h4>	Can a water jet cut through water-absorbing materials? </h4>
              <p class="p-l-align">The common belief is that a waterjet cutting machine cannot cut through soft
                 materials such as wood, as it absorbs water quickly. But that is not quite the case.

              </p>
              <p class="p-l-align">
                Water comes out of the waterjet cutter at high pressure and high speed and penetrates
                 through the material so fast that there is no time for water absorption.
              </p>

                <h4>	Can a water jet cut intricate 3D Parts? </h4>
             <p class="p-l-align">Some people doubt the capability of the 
                <a href="https://alshurooq.ae/cnc-water-jet-cutting.php" target="_blank">
               CNC waterjet cutting machine </a> to cut out precise 3D parts.

              </p>
              <p class="p-l-align">
                The recent technological advancements have enhanced the versatility of the waterjet 
                cutting machine coupled with the latest CNC and CAD technology, the cutting head can now cut out 
                complex 3D parts in a single motion.
  
              </p>

              <h4>Is waterjet cutting limited to the Aerospace industry?</h4>
             <p class="p-l-align">Waterjet cutting is widely utilized by the aerospace and aviation industries, 
              which has led to the belief that its application is limited to these industries.
              </p>
              <p class="p-l-align">
                CNC Waterjet cutting machines find their application in diverse industries such as food processing, automotive manufacturing
                , the medical industry, power generation, and the like apart from Aerospace industries.
              </p>
              <p class="p-l-align">It is easy to get caught up in myths and misconceptions. But the truth is that CNC waterjet cutting machines have developed and evolved beyond their limitations, becoming the most preferred, competent, and precise cutting solution across various industries, 
                especially cutting thick materials and nonmetals and almost all type Engineering Plastics and composites.
              </p>
              <p class="p-l-align">
