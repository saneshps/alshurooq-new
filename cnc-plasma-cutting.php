						<h2> Frequently Asked Questions on CNC Plasma Cutting </h2>
						<div id="accordion">
							<div class="accordion">
								<input type="radio" name="radacc" class="accordian-chk" checked />
								<h3 class="accordian-header active">
								1.	How does plasma cutting differ from laser cutting?
									<span class="acc-icon"></span>
								</h3>
								<div class="accordian-content" tabindex="2">
									<p>
									Both plasma cutting and laser cutting use a focused beam to cut through materials.
									 Plasma cutting uses a high-temperature jet of ionized gas, while laser cutting uses a concentrated beam of light.

									</p>
								</div>

								<input type="radio" name="radacc" class="accordian-chk" />
								<h3 class="accordian-header">
									2. What materials can be cut with CNC plasma cutting?
									<span class="acc-icon"></span>
								</h3>
								<div class="accordian-content">
									<p> CNC Plasma Cutting uses a high-velocity jet of ionized gas (Plasma) to cut through electrically
										 conductive materials like steel, Stainless Steel or aluminum. A plasma torch melts the material,
										  while the CNC system controls the cutting path with high precision. This method is widely used 
										  in industries for fast and efficient cutting of metals into custom shapes.
										 </p>
								</div>
							</div>

							<div class="accordion">
								<input type="radio" name="radacc" class="accordian-chk" />
								<h3 class="accordian-header">
									3.  What about the Heat Affected Zone (HAZ) in plasma cutting?
									<span class="acc-icon"></span>
								</h3>
								<div class="accordian-content">
									<p> In plasma cutting, the HAZ (Heat-Affected Zone) refers to the area around the cut where the material's
										 properties have been altered due to heat exposure. The size of the HAZ depends on factors like cutting speed,
										  material thickness, and the power of the plasma torch., it is still effective for many industrial
										   applications where this is not a major concern.
