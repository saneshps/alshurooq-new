              <h3> A History of CNC Machining </h3>
              <p>The history of CNC machining dates back to the mid-20th century, a time when traditional manufacturing techniques were being enhanced by new technological innovations. </p>

              <h4>1. Early Beginnings (1940s-1950s):</h4>
              <ul>
                <li> The roots of CNC machining can be traced to <strong> numerical control (NC)</strong>, a precursor technology developed in the late 1940s.In 1949, John T.
                  Parsons, an engineer, and his team at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) began developing methods to use punched cards to control machines,
                  thus giving rise to <strong> numerical control</strong>.
                </li>
                <li> By 1952, Richard Kegg and MIT had developed the first<strong> NC milling machine</strong>. It was able to automate the movements of the machine’s cutting tools using instructions provided by punched paper tape.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h4> 2. The Birth of CNC (1960s): </h4>
              <ul>
                <li> The 1960s saw the introduction of computers into the machining process, transitioning NC to <strong>CNC</strong>. </li>
                <li> Rather than relying on physical punched tapes, machines could now be programmed using computer instructions, making the system more flexible and efficient. </li>
              </ul>

              <h4> 3. Expansion and Commercialization (1970s-1980s): </h4>
              <ul>
                <li> By the 1970s, CNC machining became widely adopted in industries like aerospace, automotive, and defense due to its ability to produce highly accurate parts. </li>
                <li> The introduction of <strong> CAD (Computer-Aided Design)</strong> and <strong>CAM (Computer-Aided Manufacturing)</strong> systems
                  integrated with CNC technology allowed for the design and programming of machines to be done digitally.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h4>4. Advances in Technology (1990s-2000s): </h4>
              <ul>
                <li> During this period, CNC machines became more sophisticated, with innovations like <strong> multi-axis machining</strong>
                  (e.g., 5-axis CNC machines) that allowed for even more complex and precise manufacturing.
                </li>
                <li><strong> Automated tool changers</strong>, sensors, and feedback systems became standard in CNC machines,
                  enhancing efficiency and reducing human intervention in the production process.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h4> 5. Modern CNC Machining (2010s-Present): </h4>
              <ul>
                <li> Today, CNC machining is an integral part of manufacturing across various industries, from aerospace to medical devices,
                  automotive to electronics.The integration of <strong> IoT (Internet of Things), machine learning</strong>, and <strong>automation</strong> has further improved
                  CNC systems, allowing for smarter manufacturing processes, real-time monitoring, and predictive maintenance.
                </li>
                <li> <strong> Additive manufacturing</strong> (3D printing) and CNC machining are now often used together to combine the strengths of both technologies,
                  creating innovative production techniques.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>What Exactly is CNC Machining?</h3>

              <p> <strong>CNC machining</strong> is a manufacturing process in which pre-programmed computer software controls the movement of
                machinery and tools. This automation allows for the precise shaping, cutting, and forming of materials such as metal,
                plastic, wood, or composites into parts and products. CNC machines can perform various tasks like milling, turning,
                drilling, and cutting, all with high accuracy and consistency.
