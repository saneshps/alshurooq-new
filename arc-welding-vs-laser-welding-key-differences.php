              <h1> Arc Welding Vs Laser Welding <br>
                Key differences and Advantages
              </h1>


              <p> Welding is the process by which materials, typically metals, are fused using high
                temperature heat to form a strong joint between metals. The two major classification of
                Welding methods are Fusion Welding & Pressure Welding. Within the category of
                Fusion Welding, Arc Welding and Gas Welding are considered as more conventional
                methods whereas Laser Beam Welding, Electron Beam Welding, Plasma Arc Welding
                etc. are termed as advanced Welding processes. This blog intends to point out some of
                the key advantages and differences of Arc Welding and Laser Welding. </p>

              <h3> Arc Welding </h3>

              <p> Arc Welding refers to the most commonly employed Welding method which involves
                using heat generated by an electric arc to fuse the metal parts together. An additional
                filler material in the form of wire or rod may be added to the weld to strengthen the joint. </p>
              <h4> There are various types of Arc Welding methods:
              </h4>
              <h3 class="p-l-align"> Shielded Metal Arc Welding
              </h3>

              <p class="p-l-align"> Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW), often called Stick Welding, is one of the
                most widely used Welding processes in which an electric arc is created between a
                flux-coated consumable electrode or the "stick" and the workpiece.
              </p>

              <h3 class="p-l-align"> Metal Inert Gas Welding (MIG) </h3>
              <p class="p-l-align"> This weld is created using a consumable wire component that acts as both filler
                and electrode. </p>
              <h3 class="p-l-align"> Tungsten inert gas Welding (TIG)
              </h3>
              <p class="p-l-align"> In this Welding method, the weld bead is created by heating the workpiece using
                a non-consumable tungsten electrode. In some instances, metal fillers may be
                used to strengthen the weld joint. </p>
              <h3> Laser Welding
              </h3>
              <p> Laser Welding is the process of using a focused Laser beam, instead of the electric arc
                to heat the metal workpieces, which will in turn melt, cool and then join to form a strong
                weld. Laser beam produces a concentrated heat source which is localized to a
                particular point. </p>
              <p>It prevents the spreading of heat to the other areas of the workpiece, protecting it from
                damage.</p>
              <h3> Advantages of Arc Welding </h3>
              <h4> Arc Welding methods still serve as a good fabricating solution to many industries.
              </h4>
              <ul>
                <li> The investment cost of Arc Welding is comparatively low, which ideally fits
                  the budget range. </li>
                <li> Being the most common method that is in fact still prevalent in many
                  industries, it is easier to understand and work with it. </li>
                <li> The Welding process can be done manually at a faster pace. </li>
              </ul>
              <h3> Advantages of Laser Welding </h3>
              <h4> Laser Welding is more advanced than the Arc methods, its advantages are as follows:
              </h4>
              <ul>
                <li> Since the Laser is directed at a specific point, heat will be concentrated only
                  on that spot in particular and it significantly reduces the heat-affected zone. Its
                  precision makes it an ideal choice for working on thin workpieces. </li>
                <li> Laser Welding has comparatively high initial investment. But in the long run
                  Laser Welding will turn out to be more cost-effective, owing to its high
                  processing speed, which will enhance productivity. </li>
              </ul>
              <p> Arc Welding is the most commonly used method having application in diverse fields
                including general construction, ship building, aerospace industry etc. Being a manual
                process, Arc Welding is subject to certain limitations which include lack of high level
                precision when it comes to dealing with thin metal workpieces, the risk of creating heataffected-zones. </p>
              <p> Laser Welding on the other hand is an advanced technique which is more precise,
                efficient and productive. Arc Welding will not be outdated as it is still utilized by many
                industries. But owing to its precision and accuracy, Laser Welding is gradually
                becoming the popular choice among the various metal processing industries.
